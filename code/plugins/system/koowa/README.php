Requirements

Due to a serious security vulnerability in all Joomla 1.5.x versions, it is 
highly recommended to use 1.5.6 for all Joomla sites. Furthermore, PHP 5.2 and 
MySQL 5.0 are required. Please check these before installing.

Installation

Install the Koowa plugin through Joomla's extension installer. Make sure you 
enable the plugin in the Plugin manager. Upgrading between 0.X versions 
(eg 0.5 to 0.6) is not supported. Upgrading between 0.X.y versions (eg 0.5.0 
to 0.5.1) can be done by using the upgrade packages.
